**Tic Tac Toe Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. It utilizes HTML for the structure of the game board, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for game logic and interactivity. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first player to get three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. The game includes features such as:

- A visually appealing game board designed with CSS.
- Interactive gameplay powered by JavaScript.
- Logic to detect win conditions and handle draws.
- A user-friendly interface that resets the game for a new round after each match.

This project is an excellent example of combining front-end web development skills to create a functional and engaging game.
